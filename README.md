# cppchezz - first c++ project

finished freecodecamp's c++ course and felt like i could do anything.
welp this took me 12 hours over 4 days, which was way longer than i thought. anyways this has castling, en passant and stalemate.
playing this on main.cpp will give you headaches.

feel free to review the terrible code and maybe give me some suggestions as i move along
